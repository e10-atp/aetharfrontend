aethar is a front-end for my startup studio project built using Flutter. It is an AR app which simulates space
sharing and interaction as a means of immersive communication.

All 3D AR interactions of this app will be built by our startup team and is not considered to be apart of
this assignment. The AR interactions will be built in Unity with AR Foundation and scripted using C#.

To keep the paradigms of our product design in line, I have chosen to work in Dart using Flutter. Flutter
is cross platform (including iOS, Android, and web) and based on widgets, which allows rapid
prototyping for user testing. It has been used as a UX wrapper for some commercial AR applications in
the past. Flutter is a Google platform and has plugin in support for Firebase. Dart is an OOP
language that is similar to C#, which can minimize any transition hitches my team might have when I
hand the front-end off after submitting the milestones.

Some features needed in the front end are:
• An information/sign up public splash page
• A log-in page
• A sign-up page
• A friend or circle management page
• An inventory viewing or management page for owned 3D assets
• An AR session management page which can launch the Unity portions of our application (not developed yet)

Some requirements may change as we iterate over details of our service.
